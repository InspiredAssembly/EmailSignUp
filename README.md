EmailSignUp
===========

A window module that fades in to request a user's email address (to sign up on email list).

You can see my live version here:

Right now, it just sits there. I would like it to fade in after a few seconds, and also dim the background. Then disappear and go back to normal after the user enters their email address or clicks "cancel."

Thank you!
