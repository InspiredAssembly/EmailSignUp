  <p><span class="question">Tell Me About The Party!</span><br />
  Welcome to the biggest and longest running adult Halloween Party in Seattle. This year is the 12th Annual and it sells out every single year! Nearly 2,000 guests will converge on the EMP Museum in Downtown Seattle to enjoy multiple rooms of entertainment, theme decorations, a gigantic costume contest with over $4000 in prizes! The party is for guests 21 &amp; Over, ID's are required. The date is October 31st, 2014 Friday night, and doors open at 8 pm.</p>
  <p><span class="question">What is the PULSE theme?</span><br />
    Tonight, you're in control! Be anything you want to be! We did not want to limit you with a theme this year. This year, it's about being your ULTIMATE HALLOWEEN! This is beyond Halloween. It's excessive Halloween, exaggerated, extraordinary and fantastic costumes. Go Beyond with nearly 2,000 of your new best friends and have an incredibe time together! Tonight, it's YOUR NIGHT!</p>
  <p><span class="question">Does my costume have to be a particular theme?</span><br />
      Not at all. Tonight is the night to bring out your ultimate costume. You 
      know that costume that you've had your eye on (or it's already in your closet) 
      that makes even your crazy friends say &quot;Wow â€“ that's over the top!&quot; 
      Crazy wigs? Yes. Daring shoes? Yes! Clothing that needs double-sided tape 
      to stay in place? Oh, Yes, Yes, Yes! Let your imagination run wild! <a href="costumecontest.php">Click 
      here to learn more about the costume contest and the great prizes</a></p>
  <p><span class="question">Are there any restrictions on costumes?</span><br />
    Yes. Because the event is in a public museum, there are some rules everyone needs to follow: No face masks may be worn in gallery spaces. For public safety purposes, photo identification may be required and recorded for the entry of guests with non-removable face paint, prosthetics or masks. No functional weapons are allowed at EMP. Simulated or costume weapons are subject to inspection and approval by Security prior to entry. Every guest must have a valid, current photo ID.</p>
  <p><span class="question">What is the demographic for this party?</span><br />
    Everyone (21 &amp; over) is invited. It spans the ages of those in their 20's, 30's &amp; 40's. Couples, singles, those coming alone or in a group . . . all are invited and will have a fun time at this lively party! See the photos from last year to get an idea of who attends these events.</p>
  <p><span class="question">Looks great, how much are the tickets? </span><br />
      Prices will increase as the date gets closer, so don't wait, buy your tickets 
      now and get the best price! Click on the &quot;Tickets&quot; link at the 
      top of the page for ticket options.</p>
  <p><span class="question">Is there a Pre-Party?</span><br />
    Yes there is! For those coming by themselves or who like to get started early, we're throwing a pre-function from 6:00 to 8:00 PM. We are reserving a room at the Sport Restaurant and Bar near the EMP Museum. There will be a friendly host introducing all guests to each other and walking the group over to the party at 8:00 PM. This is a great way to meet a smaller group of party guests before walking over to the big bash! Anyone is invited to attend this pre-func. When you arrive, ask for the &quot;PULSE Pre-Party!&quot; <a href="pre_party.php">Click here for more details about the pre-party.</a></p>
  <p><span class="question">What about convenient hotel accommodations?</span><br />

    Most likely yes. This event is renowned for its big costume contest and fantastic themes. And that's the interesting part - dressing up and seeing everyone else's imaginative and fabulous creations! But if you're short on time, just grab a mask! :)</p>
  <p><span class="question">Coat Check</span><br />
    There is a free coat check available for all guests.</p>
  <p><span class="question">Bars</span><br />
    All of the bars will be CASH ONLY to keep the bar line moving. Please come prepared.</p>
  <p><span class="question">Will there be Food Available?</span><br />
